# Tour Destination Recommendation System
## Overview
This project implements a recommendation system for tour destinations, allowing users to receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The system uses Content-Based Filtering and Rule-Based Filtering to provide accurate suggestions. Collaborative Filtering is planned as a future enhancement.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends places based on similarities in attributes such as Name, State, City, Type, etc., using cosine similarity.
- **Rule-Based Filtering:** Allows users to filter destinations by specific criteria like Google review rating, entrance fee, and city/state.
- **Customizable User Input:** Users can input their preferences (e.g., minimum rating, location, fee) to get personalized recommendations.

## Future Scope
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement collaborative filtering based on user history and ratings to enhance recommendations.
